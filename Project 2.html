    NOTES TO REVIEWERS!!!

    I hate to say it but I have been reviewing some of my reviewers pretty harshly because the feedback has varied between very useful and completely unhelpful.  What's been unhelpful are blase comments that say, "go do this", without actually explaining how.   

    I've been failed on things like untidy indenting, and was given unhelpful feedback like "use a text editor that auto indents" not explaining that in some cases a package has to be installed in order to use auto indenting shortcuts:  
    
    https://superuser.com/questions/564180/is-there-an-html-auto-indentation-feature-or-plugin-for-sublime-text-aka-pretti

    or even WHICH text editor to use (I"m using sublime text) and how to enable it to format more easily ___ Because I would love to have auto indentation!! Please help me never ever ever have to think about indenting again!  (I did find sublime's re-indent option to work on this document in this case).

    Also, Ive been failed for completely irrelevant things like, "your video doesn't playback" - when I never actually linked a video.  Instead, I linked to another Udacity node that has a video in it and never meant to embed it.  

    Also, I'm sorry I really don't care about my notes as much as getting practice in creating useful code to make this god awful task of building an HTML document less painful.  I'm not here to make pretty notes, I'm here to build something I haven't been able to make before and then move on to the next courses that will help me build something even better, like an interative resume.  


    Table of contents and Lessons 1 - 2 are copied from Andy's Example!!  

    My own content is all of Lesson 3, as I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts in the previous lessons and would rather focus on getting into the next stage than reinventing the wheel with the earlier lesson notes.

    However!  I would love to know how much of this is appropriate as an assignment and if I need to add more content of my own?  More playing around with CSS and such?  

    Also, the CSS style is copied from Andy's example, as I really liked what was there and honestly didn't see much reason to change it for now.  I'm really more interested in learning more CSS properties and how to efficinetly ADD content without having to copy and paste opening and closing tags, and instead how to import content from a separate file, like a text document, that I can format and keep separate until it comes time to arrange it....Or even creating my own Wordpress style text boxes that I can format intuitively like in a word editing program instead of having to copy and paste opening and closing tag constantly....That's my excuse at least...

        How the Web Works

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. When a person goes to a web page like
          www.google.com, their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
          it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen.

          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup

          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This

          HTML documents are made of HTML

        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret
          instructions literally. This makes them very
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

          HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
          or <b>block</b>. Block elements form

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
          inside of boxes, and so on...

          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
          write an opening tag.

    <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>

    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-1">
        Adding CSS to an HTML Document 
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	In order to add CSS to an HTML document, between the &lt;Head&gt; tags, the following must be included:  
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css"&gt;
          <br>
          Where href refers to the name of the separate CSS document, which in this lesson, needs to be placed in the same location as the HTML document.
        </p>

    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title" id="lesson-3-2">
        CSS as Cascading Style Sheet
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	CSS allows for you to replace properties of parts of your HTML with other properties easily, and allows for different portions of HTML to inherit the properties from their parent class.  In this case, the &lt;div class="something"&gt; blocks we are working with, allows us to apply a style property to the overall box containing everything, like a fonts and margin sizes:  
        	<br><br>
        	.concept-description { 
        	<br> font-weight: lighter; 
        	<br> margin: 6px;
        	<br> }
        	<br> <br> Now every box that doesn't have the property font-weight specified, that is nested in .concept-description, will have the same property and thus <em> inherit </em> as a child, the property of it's parent.

        Flex Boxes?
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        	I'm still deeply confused by how flex boxes work, but adding the flex property to our container allows for boxes within it to appear next to each other in a particular order and direction.  In this case, the main example I was working with was: <br>
          <br>
          .app {
          <br>max-width: 1138px;
          <br>margin: 0 auto;
          <br>display: -webkit-flex;
          <br>display: flex;
          <br>}
          <br><br> Where .app contained most of the body of the page.

        Adding Images
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Similarly to linking a CSS document, we can add images to our website with the following <br>
          &lt;div class="image"&gt;&lt;img src="images/app.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          <br><br>
          However, for now it must be placed in the same folder as our HTML document.  This creates a box that can be styled as a container for the image.  In my other HTML document I have the css properties as:
          <br><br>
          .image { 
          <br>max-width: 460px;
          <br>}
          <br><br>
          Where it inherits the flex property from .app and ends up next to my description container.

          Avoiding Repitition
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            One of the most common problems is repeating oneself when building anything in code.  CSS helps alot with avoiding repitition as you can create a set of classes that most of your content falls into and affect it all at once with a single CSS property.  
            Also, repitition creates a problem where each individual instance of code has to be changed manually.  Using CSS, classes, and nesting in general allows one to affect most of your content with a few changes instead of having to repeat a single change over and over throughout your code.  

            Not sure what else is needed here since I have been docked twice for not understanding how to avoid repitition.  I really would like to avoid repeitition and am looking forward to moving on so I can learn the function necessary to avoid repitition instead of having to copy and paste opening and closing tags, which is all I know how to do now.  If there is more that my reviewer can tell me about what else to say here, I would love to know!

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
           What was super tough for me was comparing the mockup without knowing where to find a good source of information.  Fortunately, I was able to backtrack out of the main IPND course and look at the beginning HTML course to find the link to the samples that we had been introduced to earlier but didn't necessarily get a reference to later on.  It can be found: <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>

           Using <a href="http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/style-1.html" target="blank"> this example</a> I was able to use the developer tools to figure out the spacing and alignment that I would eventually use to create the final mockup.  I can't figure out how to get my banner text to stay in the lower left hand corner of the banner but I'm alright with how it looks.

    Evaluation Notes 1

  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      After the 1st Evaluation I learned:
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; element comes only once in a html document, the opening &lt;body&gt; tag is written after the closing 
      &lt;/head&gt; tag, and the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag comes always right before the &lt;/html&gt; tag
    </p>
    <p>
      An img tag must have an alt attribute, i recommend you to choose an appropriate text equivalent for the object.
      read more about it here,
      <a href='http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/altAttribute'> http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/altAttribute</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple CSS Style sheets can be linked to but &lt;link&gt; tags have to come in the Head section only
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the w3 every html document must have a title element in the head section, it appear in the tab bar section of the browser, it is written like this &lt;title&gt; The fundamental of HTML &lt;/title&gt;
      Here is the source, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.4.2">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.4.2</a>
      And i recommend you to add always a document type tag in the beginning of a page. 
      It is written like this, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      Read more about it here, <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/Doctype">http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/Doctype</a>

    <p>
      a &lt;p&gt;  tag can't contain a &lt;div&gt; tag, because the &lt;div&gt; tag is a block level elements, <p> tag can not contain block level elements including itself.

      In begining this second project, I had an understanding of for loops, while loops, string indexing and concatenation, but I had no idea how we were going to produce HTML tags around our text.  <br />I was relieved to know that we would learn something useful to do this but I was horrified by the first exercises where we had to perform string matching to slice apart a giant block of text to create our notes like so:<br />def generate_concept_HTML(concept_title, concept_description):<br />    html_text_1 = + '''<br /> &lt; div class="concept" &gt; <br />     &lt; div class="concept-title" &gt; <br />        ''' + concept_title<br />    html_text_2 = '''<br />     &lt; /div &gt; <br />     &lt; div class="concept-description" &gt; <br />        ''' + concept_description<br />    html_text_3 = '''<br />     &lt; /div &gt; <br /> &lt; /div &gt; '''<br />    <br />    full_html_text = html_text_1 + html_text_2 + html_text_3<br />    return full_html_text<br /><br />def get_title(concept):<br />    start_location = concept.find('TITLE:')<br />    end_location = concept.find('DESCRIPTION:')<br />    title = concept[start_location+7 : end_location-1]<br />    return title<br /><br />def get_description(concept):<br />    start_location = concept.find('DESCRIPTION:')<br />    description = concept[start_location+13 :]<br />    return description<br /><br />def get_concept_by_number(text, concept_number):<br />    counter = 0<br />    while counter  &lt;  concept_number:<br />        counter = counter + 1<br />        next_concept_start = text.find('TITLE:')<br />        next_concept_end   = text.find('TITLE:', next_concept_start + 1)<br />        if next_concept_end  &gt; = 0:<br />            concept = text[next_concept_start:next_concept_end]<br />        else:<br />            next_concept_end = len(text)<br />            concept = text[next_concept_start:]<br />        text = text[next_concept_end:]<br />    return concept<br /><br />TEST_TEXT = """TITLE: Why Computers are Stupid<br />DESCRIPTION: The phrase "computers are stupid" refers <br />to how they interpret instructions literally.

    <div class="concept-description">
      Using lists, we learned how to take less steps in separating out our content and I realized I could automate the generation of the html for my sublists by adding an extra list item after my content.  <br />                             Being very lazy on my part, I decided just to copy over the output from my python file instead of pasting in all the previous content into the python list (because that would have taken forever and I would rather learn sometehing new) and make a few tweaks once I had placed my content safely in my HTML document.  <br />                             A few tweaks here and there, and realizing that I hadn't added an h2 tag to beginning of this new section, nor had I thought to nest my content even further to include headers and the section heading around my content...

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
      <p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called <i>user-defined functions.</i></p>
      <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
      <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</p></li>
        <li><p>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</p></li>
        <li><p>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or <i>docstring</i>.</p></li>
        <li><p>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</p></li>
        <li><p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        def functionname( parameters ):
        "function_docstring"
        function_suite
        return [expression]
      </pre>
      <p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        def printme( str ):
        "This prints a passed string into this function"
        print str
        return
      </pre>
      <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
      <p>Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>
      <p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is the example to call printme() function &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printme( str ):
        "This prints a passed string into this function"
        print str;
        return;

        # Now you can call printme function
        printme("I'm first call to user defined function!");
        printme("Again second call to the same function");
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        I'm first call to user defined function!
        Again second call to the same function
      </pre>
      <h2>Pass by reference vs value</h2>
      <p>All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. For example &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def changeme( mylist ):
        "This changes a passed list into this function"
        mylist.append([1,2,3,4]);
        print "Values inside the function: ", mylist
        return

        # Now you can call changeme function
        mylist = [10,20,30];
        changeme( mylist );
        print "Values outside the function: ", mylist
      </pre>
      <p>Here, we are maintaining reference of the passed object and appending values in the same object. So, this would produce the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Values inside the function:  [10, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]]
        Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]]
      </pre>
      <p>There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def changeme( mylist ):
        "This changes a passed list into this function"
        mylist = [1,2,3,4]; # This would assig new reference in mylist
        print "Values inside the function: ", mylist
        return

        # Now you can call changeme function
        mylist = [10,20,30];
        changeme( mylist );
        print "Values outside the function: ", mylist
      </pre>
      <p>The parameter <i>mylist</i> is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect <i>mylist</i>. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Values inside the function:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
        Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30]
      </pre>
      <h2>Function Arguments</h2>
      <p>You can call a function by using the following types of formal arguments:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Required arguments</p></li>
        <li><p>Keyword arguments</p></li>
        <li><p>Default arguments</p></li>
        <li><p>Variable-length arguments</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Required arguments</h2>
      <p>Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order. Here, the number of arguments in the function call should match exactly with the function definition.</p>
      <p>To call the function <i>printme()</i>, you definitely need to pass one argument, otherwise it gives a syntax error as follows &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printme( str ):
        "This prints a passed string into this function"
        print str;
        return;

        # Now you can call printme function
        printme();
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "test.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
        printme();
        TypeError: printme() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
      </pre>
      <h2>Keyword arguments</h2>
      <p>Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.</p>
      <p>This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the <i>printme()</i> function in the following ways &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printme( str ):
        "This prints a passed string into this function"
        print str;
        return;

        # Now you can call printme function
        printme( str = "My string");
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        My string
      </pre>
      <p>The following example gives more clear picture. Note that the order of parameters does not matter.</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printinfo( name, age ):
        "This prints a passed info into this function"
        print "Name: ", name;
        print "Age ", age;
        return;

        # Now you can call printinfo function
        printinfo( age=50, name="miki" );
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Name:  miki
        Age  50
      </pre>
      <h2>Default arguments</h2>
      <p>A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. The following example gives an idea on default arguments, it prints default age if it is not passed &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printinfo( name, age = 35 ):
        "This prints a passed info into this function"
        print "Name: ", name;
        print "Age ", age;
        return;

        # Now you can call printinfo function
        printinfo( age=50, name="miki" );
        printinfo( name="miki" );
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Name:  miki
        Age  50
        Name:  miki
        Age  35
      </pre>
      <h2>Variable-length arguments</h2>
      <p>You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function. These arguments are called <i>variable-length</i> arguments and are not named in the function definition, unlike required and default arguments.</p>
      <p>Syntax for a function with non-keyword variable arguments is this &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        def functionname([formal_args,] *var_args_tuple ):
        "function_docstring"
        function_suite
        return [expression]
      </pre>
      <p>An asterisk (*) is placed before the variable name that holds the values of all nonkeyword variable arguments. This tuple remains empty if no additional arguments are specified during the function call. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def printinfo( arg1, *vartuple ):
        "This prints a variable passed arguments"
        print "Output is: "
        print arg1
        for var in vartuple:
        print var
        return;

        # Now you can call printinfo function
        printinfo( 10 );
        printinfo( 70, 60, 50 );
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Output is:
        10
        Output is:
        70
        60
        50
      </pre>
      <h2>The <i>Anonymous</i> Functions</h2>
      <p>These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the <i>def</i> keyword. You can use the <i>lambda</i> keyword to create small anonymous functions.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.</p></li>
        <li><p>An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression</p></li>
        <li><p>Lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.</p></li>
        <li><p>Although it appears that lambda's are a one-line version of a function, they are not equivalent to inline statements in C or C++, whose purpose is by passing function stack allocation during invocation for performance reasons.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>The syntax of <i>lambda</i> functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        lambda [arg1 [,arg2,.....argn]]:expression
      </pre>
      <p>Following is the example to show how <i>lambda</i> form of function works &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2;



        # Now you can call sum as a function
        print "Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 )
        print "Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 )
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Value of total :  30
        Value of total :  40
      </pre>
      <h2>The <i>return</i> Statement</h2>
      <p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>
      <p>All the above examples are not returning any value. You can return a value from a function as follows &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        # Function definition is here
        def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
        # Add both the parameters and return them."
        total = arg1 + arg2
        print "Inside the function : ", total
        return total;

        # Now you can call sum function
        total = sum( 10, 20 );
        print "Outside the function : ", total 
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Inside the function :  30
        Outside the function :  30
      </pre>
      <h2>Scope of Variables</h2>
      <p>All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program. This depends on where you have declared a variable.</p>
      <p>The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. There are two basic scopes of variables in Python  &minus;</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><p>Global variables</p></li>
        <li><p>Local variables</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Global vs. Local variables</h2>
      <p>Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.</p>
      <p>This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
        #!/usr/bin/python

        total = 0; # This is global variable.
        # Function definition is here
        def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
        # Add both the parameters and return them."
        total = arg1 + arg2; # Here total is local variable.
        print "Inside the function local total : ", total
        return total;

        # Now you can call sum function
        sum( 10, 20 );
        print "Outside the function global total : ", total 
      </pre>
      <p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
        Inside the function local total :  30
        Outside the function global total :  0
